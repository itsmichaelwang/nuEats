A website to display information about Northwestern's dining services in a responsive and mobile-friendly form.

- The folders are files for Twitter Bootstrap v3.1.1.
- 'jquery-1.10.1.min.js' is the jQuery file (normally can be pulled from link, I used a file because Google Drive hosting was not working with the link).
- 'arrow.png' is the arrow used in the "equivalency-rate-bars" up top. It was pulled from the Bootstrap web page and cropped to fit using MS Paint.
- The .html, .css, and .js files in the main directory are website files created by me.
